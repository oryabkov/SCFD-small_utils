1) static_assert is obsolete here (because of c++11)
2) system_timer_event could be reaplced with c++11 timer
3) in log_std prhaps it's more correct to use std::cout 
   (however, I still use sprintf here, so I'm not sure)
4) add log_mpi
5) add standalone version to logs (to be used with AMGX, for example)
6) think about adding log parameter to functions, not just classes
   (for example, init_cuda).
7) timers are non non-movable because cuda_time doesnot have any
   'uninited' state (it creates timer right in default constructor).
   Not sure if it is a problem, because I usually don't move or copy
   timers. But perhaps there will arise reason to do it at some point.
8) convert tests to gtest version and add cmake
9) Why we are so afraid of shared_ptr<>? In some cases it won't hurt at
   all. For example, it's convinient to store pointer in log_basic_wrap
   as shared and logged_obj_base can store pointer to Log as shared.
